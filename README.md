# üåø EcoCart: The greener way to shop!

*Submission for Lifehack 2025*

## Problem Statement

Challenge:
Design a sustainability shopping companion ‚Äî a browser extension or mobile application ‚Äî that provides users real-time information about the environmental sustainability of brands and products as they shop online. The app should offer alternative recommendations, detailed sustainability scores, and easy-to-understand visual indicators of environmental impact.

## Background
![chart](assets/chart.png)

Consumers often unintentionally support unsustainable practices due to a lack of clear information about the environmental impacts of their purchases. According to a 2023 McKinsey report, 68% of consumers want to make sustainable choices but lack accessible and reliable information to do so.

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Solution: EcoCart

### Features
<div align="center">
    <table>
    <tr>
        <td align="center">
        <img src="assets/overall.png" alt="Icon 1" width="200"/>
        <br/><sub>Overall brand score</sub>
        </td>
        <td align="center">

        <br/><sub>Carbon footprint calculator</sub>
        </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
</div>

- Real-Time Brand Sustainability Scores
    - EcoCart scrapes product brand names on shopping websites and cross-references them with publicly available data from Good On You, a trusted sustainability database. Users instantly see how a brand fares on environmental, labor, and animal welfare criteria.

- Carbon Footprint Estimation
    - Our extension estimates the carbon impact of products based on the typical manufacturing locations and supply chain assumptions derived from brand data and public sustainability reports.

        <br/><sub>Sustainable recommendations</sub>
        </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
</div>

- Generative Summaries & Recommendations

    - EcoCart uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models to generate explanations of eco-friendly or harmful practices in the brand‚Äôs supply chain.

    - Suggestions of alternative products that score higher in sustainability, based on live web search and the user's current shopping interest.
- Simple and Actionable Visual Indicators
- Color-coded badges and tooltips make sustainability information understandable at a glance, encouraging responsible choices without cognitive overload.
