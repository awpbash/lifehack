However its use of eco-friendly materials reduces its climate impact and limits the amount of chemicals, water and wastewater used in production. Its labour rating is 'good'. There is no evidence it has a Code of Conduct but it has a formal statement covering workers rights. It is unclear whether it ensures payment of a living wage in its supply chain.
