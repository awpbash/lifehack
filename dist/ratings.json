However its use of eco-friendly materials reduces its climate impact and limits the amount of chemicals, water and wastewater used in production. Its labour rating is 'good'. There is no evidence it has a Code of Conduct but it has a formal statement covering workers rights. It is unclear whether it ensures payment of a living wage in its supply chain.

    "description": "Boucheron is owned by Kering.Our “Planet” rating evaluates brands based on the environmental policies in their supply chains, from carbon emissions and wastewater to business models and product circularity. Here we rate Boucheron “Good”. These are a few factors influencing its score:It uses a medium proportion of lower-impact materials including recycled materials.It’s set a science based target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in both its direct operations and supply chain, and it claims it’s on track.It takes some actions to reduce water use in its supply chain.There’s no evidence it takes action to minimise its packaging, which is a driver of plastic waste.Workers’ rights are central to our “People” rating, which assess brands’ policies and practices on everything from child labour to living wages and gender equality. Here we rate Boucheron “It’s a Start”. These are a few factors influencing its score:Its final production stage happens in medium risk countries for labour abuse.It received a score of 41-50% in the 2022 Fashion Transparency Index.It has a comprehensive policy to support diversity and inclusion in its direct operations but not in its supply chain.It claims to have a program to improve wages but there’s no evidence it ensures its workers are paid living wages in most of its supply chain.During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, it disclosed adequate policies to protect workers in its supply chain from the virus. Brands’ animal welfare policies and, where applicable, how well they trace their animal-derived products are the focus of our “Animals” rating. Here we rate Boucheron “It’s a Start”. These are a few factors influencing its score:It has a formal policy aligned with the Five Domains of animal welfare.It appears to use leather and exotic animal skin.It doesn’t appear to use wool, down, fur, angora, or exotic animal hair.It traces most animal-derived materials to the first production stage.Based on all publicly available information we’ve reviewed, we rate Boucheron “Good” overall.",
